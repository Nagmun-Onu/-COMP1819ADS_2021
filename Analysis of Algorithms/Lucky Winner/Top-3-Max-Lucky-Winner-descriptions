Now it is a bit harder. I can still use the provided text file that has 20 lucky Banner ids randomly selected for today. 
Write a program to output the top 3 max ids without rearranging the list (without sorting). 
Examples
Input:
1 6 3 8 9 10 7 4 
Outputs:
10 9 8 
Comment:
Ids are Banner IDs provided in the lucky_ids_4.txt, each ids in its own line
Extra
• Did you use any sorting method? 
• Efficiency: Is my algorithm is good for one million records? 
* How can I improve this algorithm?
