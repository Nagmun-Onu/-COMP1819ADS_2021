Now it is even harder. I can still use the provided text file that has 20 lucky Banner ids randomly selected for today. 
My task is to write a program to output the two winning values that is closest to a winning number without rearranging the list.
Examples
Input
1 6 3 8 9 10 7 4
5
Output:
6 4 
Comment:
List of ids on the first line, and the winning 
number is 5 on the 2nd line. Values 6 and 4 
are the winning values, as they are 
“closest” to value 5. 

Extra
 Is this algorithm is good for one million records? 
 How can I improve this algorithm?
