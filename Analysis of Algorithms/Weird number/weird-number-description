Determine if a number is ”weird.” 
Given an integer n, perform the following conditional actions:
• If n is odd, print Weird
• If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 9, print Not Weird
• If n is even and in the inclusive range of 10 to 30, print Weird
• If n is even and greater than 30, print Not Weird
Input Format
• A single line containing a positive integer n.
Constraints
• 1 <= n <= 100
Output Format
• Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird
Examples
1)
Input Output Explanation
input: 3 
output: Weird 
explanation: n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.
2)
input: 34 
output: Not Weird 
explanation: n > 30 and is even, so it is not weird.
Hints
• use nested if else as you noticed. 
• Correctness: Compare your answer with inputs of 2, 9, 10, 30, 100
