# A short Python function, minmax(sequence), 
# that takes a sequence of one or more numbers, 
# and returns the smallest and largest numbers, 
# in the form of a tuple of length two.
# Given Input 
[1, 2, 3, 5] 
# Expected Output
(1, 5)
# Given Input 
[0, 1, -2] 
# Expected Output
(-2, 1)
# Given Input 
[3] 
# Expected Output
(3, 3)
# • Correctness: is output in the form of a Python tuple?
# • Efficiency: 
# NOT to use the built-in functions min or max in implementing solution 
# Is this faster than the built-in functions one.
