# -COMP1819ADS_2021
A solid foundation module for understanding the fundamentals of data structure and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation for problem-solving.
The desirable skills that employers ask for in a computing graduate is the ability to decompose a problem into manageable components and to use appropriate algorithms to solve the resulting sub-problems.
Building on the fundamental courses of mathematics and programming, this course took me through the common fundamentals of data structures, algorithms and problem-solving including:
Analysis of Algorithms, 
Stacks, 
Queue and Priority Queues, 
Linear and Binary search, 
Sorting, 
Maps, Dictionaries and Hashes, 
Binary Search Trees, 
and other common algorithms. 

Special thanks to Module Leader Dr. Tuan Vuong
